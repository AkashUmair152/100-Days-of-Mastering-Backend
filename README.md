# üöÄ 100 Days of Mastering Backend Development

This repository documents my journey through a structured 100-day plan to master backend development, focusing on Node.js, Express, Databases, REST APIs, Authentication, and more.

Based on the comprehensive roadmap: [100 Days of Backend Development](100%20Days%20of%20Backend%20Development.docx)

## üéØ Goals

By the end of this challenge, I aim to have a solid understanding and practical experience in:

*   **Node.js Fundamentals:** Core modules, file system operations, NPM.
*   **Web Servers & Frameworks:** Building servers with `http` and `Express.js`.
*   **Databases:** Working with MongoDB and Mongoose ODM.
*   **RESTful API Development:** Designing, building, testing, and securing APIs.
*   **Authentication & Security:** Implementing JWT, securing APIs against common threats.
*   **Advanced Backend Concepts:** File handling, WebSockets, Caching (Redis), Logging.
*   **Project Structure & Best Practices:** Organizing code, configuration, linting.
*   **Deployment:** Deploying a full-stack application to a cloud platform.
